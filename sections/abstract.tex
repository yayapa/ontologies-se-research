\textbf{Abstract.} Retrieving Knowledge is an essential part of human being that distinguishes us from other creatures. One of the instrument for organizing and transferring knowledge understandable not only for humans, but also for computers is an ontology. This seminar work aims at investigating ontologies in Software-Engineering-Meta-Research and trying to analyze the retrieved information, in order to obtain knowledge in this scientific field. Moreover, ontologies are closely related to the Semantic search that is used by every contemporary search engine such as Google, Bing, Yandex etc. The purpose of this seminar was, however, investigating of scientific search engines with focus on applying ontologies in them.
