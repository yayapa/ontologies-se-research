Ontology Web Search Engine is software to look for and index ontologies in the Web. OWL (Web Ontology Languages) ontologies are meant, and they are necessary for the functioning of the SWES (Semantic Web Expert System). SWES is an expert system that will use found ontologies from the Web, generating rules from them, and will supplement its knowledge base with these generated rules. It is expected that the SWES will serve as a universal expert system for the average user.},

	year = 	"2019",
	abstract =	"Ontologies of research areas are important tools for
	characterising, exploring, and analysing the research
	landscape. Some fields of research are comprehensively
	described by large-scale taxonomies, e.g., MeSH in
	Biology and PhySH in Physics. Conversely, current
	Computer Science taxonomies are coarse-grained and tend
	to evolve slowly. For instance, the ACM classification
	scheme contains only about 2K research topics and the
	last version dates back to 2012. In this paper, we
	introduce the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a
	large-scale, automatically generated ontology of
	research areas, which includes about 14K topics and
	162K semantic relationships. It was created by applying
	the Klink-2 algorithm on a very large dataset of 16M
	scientific articles. CSO presents two main advantages
	over the alternatives: i) it includes a very large
	number of topics that do not appear in other
	classifications, and ii) it can be updated
	automatically by running Klink-2 on recent corpora of
	publications. CSO powers several tools adopted by the
	editorial team at Springer Nature and has been used to
	enable a variety of solutions, such as classifying
	research publications, detecting research communities,
	and predicting research trends. To facilitate the
	uptake of CSO, we have also released the CSO
	Classifier, a tool for automatically classifying
	research papers, and the CSO Portal, a web application
	that enables users to download, explore, and provide
	granular feedback on CSO. Users can use the portal to
	navigate and visualise sections of the ontology, rate
	topics and relationships, and suggest missing ones. The
	portal will support the publication of and access to
	regular new releases of CSO, with the aim of providing
	a comprehensive resource to the various research
	communities engaged with scholarly data.",
